# deverse
This repo holds my development environment - the development universe and therefore deverse ;)

## the setup
the host is a amd64 machine running debian.

1. install os
2. setup ssh to git and the rpi's
3. install docker 'sudo apt-get install docker' and docker compose 'sudo apt-get install docker-compose'
